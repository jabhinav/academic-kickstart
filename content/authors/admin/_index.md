Hi, my name is Abhinav Jain. I work as a Research Engineer at IBM Research, India. I am broadly interested in multi-modal analytics where deep learning based algorithms are used to analyse content in text, images and videos for reasoning and further decision-making. 

I have worked for two years on IBM Watson Compare & Comply service for structured data extraction from business documents. I have also been working on smart data preparation for downstream processing in AI based systems.
